# urlshortener
----
This is a urlshortener "project" to familiarize with c# and asp.net. I grab this project from codingchallenges.fyi -> https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-url-shortener/
The process that I have been doing are: 
- First hash the Url to MD5.
- Encode and truncate it with Base64
- Redirect the short Url to the original url
- Validate the process and inputs

---
## Future things to do
- [ ] Can delete the shortened url
- [ ] GUI
